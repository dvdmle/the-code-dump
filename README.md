# Development

We use this command to commit changes to the repository:

`git commit -am "[PUT YOUR MESSAGE HERE]"`

Remember to save all files before committing!

We use this command to push changes to the GitHub repo:

`git push`

Eventually, we will work with branches and stuff to compartmentalize our work and be saferâ€”avoid overwriting one another's changes

For now, feel free to commit and push to main. Best practice is to be sure to have git-pulled before making any changes, but beware that this can overwrite local work if not done properly. IF GIT PUSH ERRORS, DO NOT FORCE PUSH. Reach out on Discord, please!

The command to sync the repo down from the website:

`git pull`

If the changes don't show automatically, reload the file(s) is VSCode by closing without saving and reopening.
